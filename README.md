# statistical-arbitrage-model-
Built a fully automated statistical arbitrage (pairs trading) strategy on NIFTY 50 stocks using cointegration and correlation-based pair selection. Implemented OLS hedge ratios, z-score driven long-short trades, and backtesting with risk metrics (alpha, beta, Sharpe) benchmarked against NIFTY 50.
